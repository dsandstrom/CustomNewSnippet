# Custom New Snippet

Adds a menu item under *Tools* for a "Custom New Snippet".  This snippet is similar to the normal new snippet except that it doesn't have the annoying comments that you have to delete every time.  Also, yukele added a snippet within the new snippet that allows quicker snippetfying.
